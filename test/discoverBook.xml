        <db:title>BELIEFS AS TO THE WORLD FOUR HUNDRED YEARS AGO</db:title>
        <db:para>Four hundred years ago most of the people who lived in Europe thought that the earth
            was flat. They knew only the land that was near them. They knew the continent of Europe,
            a small part of Asia, and a strip along the northern shore of Africa.</db:para>
        <db:para>They thought this known land was surrounded by a vast body of water that was like a
            broad river. Sailors were afraid to venture far upon this water, for they feared they
            would fall over the edge of the earth.</db:para>
        <db:para>Other seafaring men believed that if they should sail too far out upon this water
            their vessels would be lost in a fog, or that they would suddenly begin to slide
            downhill, and would never be able to return. Wind gods and storm gods, too, were
            supposed to dwell upon this mysterious sea. Men believed that these wind and storm gods
            would be very angry with any one who dared to enter their domain, and that in their
            wrath they would hurl the ships over the edge of the earth, or keep them wandering round
            and round in a circle, in the mist and fog.</db:para>
        <db:para>It is no wonder that the name "Sea of Darkness" was given to this great body of water,
            which we now know to be the Atlantic Ocean; nor is it surprising that the sailors feared
            to venture far out upon it.</db:para>
        <db:para>These sailors had no dread at all of a sea called the Mediterranean, upon which they
            made voyages without fear of danger. This sea was named the Mediterranean because it was
            supposed to be in the middle of the land that was then known. On this body of water the
            sailors were very bold, fighting, robbing, and plundering strangers and foes, without
            any thought of fear.</db:para>
        <db:para>They sailed through this sea eastward to Constantinople, their ships being loaded with
            metals, woods, and pitch. These they traded for silks, cashmeres, dyewoods, spices,
            perfumes, precious stones, ivory, and pearls. All of these things were brought by
            caravan from the far Eastern countries, as India, China, and Japan, to the cities on the
            east coast of the Mediterranean.</db:para>
        <db:para>This caravan journey was a very long and tiresome one. Worse than this, the Turks,
            through whose country the caravans passed, began to see how valuable this trade was, and
            they sent bands of robbers to prevent the caravans from reaching the coast.</db:para>
        <db:para>As time went on, these land journeys grew more difficult and more dangerous, until the
            traders saw that the day would soon come when they would be entirely cut off from
            traffic with India and the rich Eastern countries. The Turks would secure all their
            profitable business. So the men of that time tried to think of some other way of
            reaching the East.</db:para>
        <db:para>Among those who wished to find a short route to India was Prince Henry of Portugal, a
            bold navigator as well as a studious and thoughtful man. He was desirous of securing the
            rich Indian trade for his own country. So he established a school for navigators at
            Lisbon, and gathered around him many men who wanted to study about the sea.</db:para>
        <db:para>Here they made maps and charts, and talked with one another about the strange lands
            which they thought might be found far out in that mysterious body of water which they so
            dreaded and feared. It is probable that they had heard some accounts of the voyages of
            other navigators on this wonderful sea, and the beliefs about land beyond.</db:para>
        <db:para>There was Eric the Red, a bold navigator of Iceland, who had sailed west to Greenland,
            and planted there a colony that grew and thrived. There was also Eric's son Leif, a
            venturesome young viking who had made a voyage south from Greenland, and reached a
            strange country with wooded shores and fragrant vines. This country he called Vinland
            because of the abundance of wild grapes. When he returned to Greenland, he took a load
            of timber back with him.</db:para>
        <db:para>Some of the people of Greenland had tried to make a settlement along this shore which
            Leif discovered, but it is thought that the Indians drove them away. It may now be said
            of this settlement that no trace of it has ever been found, although the report that the
            Norsemen paid many visits to the shore of North America is undoubtedly true.</db:para>
        <db:para>Another bold sea rover of Portugal sailed four hundred miles from land, where he
            picked up a strangely carved paddle and several pieces of wood of a sort not to be found
            in Europe.</db:para>
        <db:para>St. Brandon, an Irish priest, was driven in a storm far, far to the west, and landed
            upon the shore of a strange country, inhabited by a race of people different from any he
            had ever seen.</db:para>
        <db:para>All this time the bold Portuguese sailors were venturing farther and farther down the
            coast of Africa. They hoped to be able to sail around that continent and up the other
            side to India. But they dared not go beyond the equator, because they did not know the
            stars in the southern hemisphere and therefore had no guide. They also believed that
            beyond the equator there was a frightful region of intense heat, where the sun scorched
            the earth and where the waters boiled.</db:para>
        <db:para>Many marvelous stories were told about the islands which the sailors said they saw in
            the distance. Scarcely a vessel returned from a voyage without some new story of signs
            of land seen by the crew.</db:para>
        <db:para>The people who lived on the Canary Islands said that an island with high mountains on
            it could be seen to the west on clear days, but no one ever found it.</db:para>
        <db:para>Some thought these islands existed only in the imagination of the sailors. Others
            thought they were floating islands, as they were seen in many different places. Every
            one was anxious to find them, for they were said to be rich in gold and spices.</db:para>
        <db:para>You can easily understand how excited many people were in regard to new lands, and how
            they wished to find out whether the earth was round or not. There was but one way to
            find out, and that was to try to sail around it.</db:para>
        <db:para>For a long time no one was brave enough to venture to do so. To start out and sail
            away from land on this unknown water was to the people of that day as dangerous and
            foolhardy a journey as to try to cross the ocean in a balloon is to us at the present
            time.</db:para>

        <db:title>MARCO POLO</db:title>
        <db:para>In the middle of the thirteenth century, about two hundred years before the time of
            Columbus, a boy named Marco Polo lived in the city of Venice.</db:para>
        <db:para>Marco Polo belonged to a rich and noble family, and had all the advantages of study
            that the city afforded. He studied at one of the finest schools in the city of Venice.
            This city was then famous for its schools, and was the seat of culture and learning for
            the known world.</db:para>
        <db:para>When Marco Polo started for school in the morning, he did not step out into a street,
            as you do. Instead, he stepped from his front doorstep into a boat called a gondola; for
            Venice is built upon a cluster of small islands, and the streets are water ways and are
            called canals.</db:para>
        <db:para>The gondolier, as the man who rows the gondola is called, took Marco wherever he
            wished to go. Sometimes, as they glided along, the gondolier would sing old Venetian
            songs; and as Marco Polo lay back against the soft cushions and listened and looked
            about him, he wondered if anywhere else on earth there was so beautiful a city as
            Venice. For the sky was very blue, and often its color was reflected in the water; the
            buildings were graceful and beautiful, the sun was warm and bright, and the air was
            balmy.</db:para>
        <db:para>In this delightful city Marco Polo lived until he was seventeen years of age. About
            this time, his father, who owned a large commercial house in Constantinople, told Marco
            that he might go with him on a long journey to Eastern countries. The boy was very glad
            to go, and set out with his father and his uncle, who were anxious to trade and gain
            more wealth in the East. This was in the year 1271.</db:para>
        <db:para>The three Polos traveled across Persia into China, and across the Desert of Gobi to
            the northwest, where they found the great ruler, Kublai Khan. This monarch was a
            kind-hearted and able man. He wanted to help his subjects to become civilized and
            learned, as the Europeans were. So Kublai Khan assisted the two elder Polos in their
            business of trading, and took Marco into his service.</db:para>
        <db:para>Soon Marco learned the languages of Asia, and then he was sent by the khan on errands
            of state to different parts of the country. He visited all the great cities in China,
            and traveled into the interior of Asia to places almost unknown at the present time.</db:para>
        <db:para>At length the three Polos expressed a desire to return to Venice. The great khan did
            not wish to part with them, but he at last consented; for he found that by going they
            could do him a service. The service required was their escort for a beautiful young
            princess who was to be taken from Peking to Tabriz, where she was to marry the Khan of
            Persia.</db:para>
        <db:para>It was difficult to find any one trustworthy enough to take charge of so important a
            person on so long and dangerous a journey. But Kublai Khan had faith in the Polos. They
            had traveled more than any one else he knew, and were cautious and brave.</db:para>
        <db:para>So he gave them permission to return to their home, and requested them to take the
            princess to Tabriz on the way. It was decided that the journey should be made by sea, as
            the land route was so beset by robbers as to be unsafe. Besides, the Polos were fine
            sailors.</db:para>
        <db:para>They started from the eastern coast of China, and continued their voyage for three
            years, around the peninsula of Cochin China, and through the Indian Ocean to the Persian
            Gulf. Here they went ashore, and then proceeded by land across Persia to Tabriz. They
            left the princess in that city, and resumed their journey by way of the Bosporus to
            Venice.</db:para>
        <db:para>When they reached Venice they found that they had been forgotten by their friends.
            They had been away twenty-four years, and in that time everything had changed very much.
            They themselves had grown older, and their clothes differed from those worn by the
            Venetians; for fashions changed even in the thirteenth century, although not so often as
            they change at the present time. It is no wonder that the Polos were not known until
            they recalled themselves to the memory of their friends.</db:para>
        <db:para>One evening they invited a few of their old friends to dinner, and during the evening
            they brought out three old coats. These coats they proceeded to rip apart, and out from
            the linings dropped all kinds of precious stones—diamonds, sapphires, emeralds, and
            rubies. In this way these wary travelers had hidden their wealth and treasure while on
            their perilous journey. The visitors were astonished at the sight of so great riches,
            and listened eagerly to the accounts of the countries from which they came.</db:para>
        <db:para>Soon after the return of Marco Polo to Venice, he took part with his countrymen in a
            battle against the Genoese. The city of Genoa, like the city of Venice, had a large
            trade with the East. These two cities were rivals in trade, and were very jealous of
            each other. Whenever Venetian ships and those of the Genoese met on the Mediterranean
            Sea, the sailors found some way of starting a quarrel. The quarrel quickly led to a sea
            fight, and it was in one of these combats that Marco Polo engaged. The Venetians were
            defeated, and Marco Polo was taken prisoner and cast into a dungeon. Here he spent his
            time in writing the wonderful book in which he described his travels.</db:para>
        <db:para>The descriptions Polo gave of the East were as wonderful as fairy tales. He told of
            countries rich in gold, silver, and precious stones, and of islands where diamonds
            sparkled on the shore. The rulers of these countries wore garments of rich silk covered
            with glittering gems, and dwelt in palaces, the roofs of which were made of gold.</db:para>
        <db:para>He described golden Cathay, with its vast cities rich in manufactures, and also
            Cipango, Hindustan, and Indo-China. He knew of the Indies Islands, rich in spices, and
            he described Siberia, and told of the sledges drawn by dogs, and of the polar bears. The
            fact that an ocean washed the eastern coast of Asia was proved by him, and this put at
            rest forever the theory that there was an impassable swamp east of Asia.</db:para>
        <db:para>This book by Marco Polo was eagerly read, and the facts that it stated were so
            remarkable that many people refused to believe them. It stirred others with a desire to
            travel and see those lands for themselves.</db:para>
        <db:para>Traveling by land, however, was very dangerous, because of the bands of robbers by
            which the country was occupied. These outlaws robbed every one whom they suspected of
            having any money, and often murdered travelers in order to gain their possessions. Sea
            travel, too, was just as dangerous, but in a different way.</db:para>
        <db:para>You will remember why sailors dared not venture far out upon the ocean and search for
            a water route to the Eastern countries and islands. The time was soon coming, however,
            when they would dare to do so, and two wonderful inventions helped navigators very much.</db:para>
        <db:para>One came from the finding of the loadstone, or natural magnet. This is a stone which
            has the power of attracting iron. A steel needle rubbed on it becomes magnetized, as we
            say, and, when suspended by the center and allowed to move freely, always swings around
            until it points north and south. Hung on a pivot and inclosed in a box, this instrument
            is called the mariners' compass. It was of great importance to sailors, because it
            always told them which way was north. On cloudy days, and during dark, stormy nights,
            when the sun and stars could not be seen, the sailors could now keep on their way, far
            from land, and still know in which direction they were going.</db:para>
        <db:para>The other invention was that of the astrolabe. This was an instrument by means of
            which sailors measured the height of the sun above the horizon at noon, and could thus
            tell the distance of the ship from the equator. It is in use on all the ships at the
            present time, but it has been greatly improved, and is now called the quadrant.</db:para>
        <db:para>The compass and the astrolabe, together with improved maps and charts, made it
            possible for navigators to tell where their ship was when out of sight of land or in the
            midst of storm and darkness. This made them more courageous, and they ventured a little
            farther from the coast, but still no one dared to sail far out upon the Sea of
        Darkness.</db:para>

        <db:title>COLUMBUS</db:title>
        <db:para>One day a man appeared in Portugal, who said he was certain that the earth was round,
            and that he could reach India by sailing westward. Every one laughed at him and asked
            him how he would like to try. He answered that he would sail round the earth, if any one
            would provide him with ships.</db:para>
        <db:para>People jeered and scoffed.</db:para>
        <db:para>"If the earth is a sphere," they said, "in order to sail round it you must sail
            uphill! Who ever heard of a ship sailing uphill?"</db:para>
        <db:para>But this man, whose name was Christopher Columbus, remained firm in his belief.</db:para>
        <db:para>When a boy, Columbus had listened eagerly to the stories the sailors told about
            strange lands and wonderful islands beyond the water. He was in the habit of sitting on
            the wharves and watching the ships. Often he would say, "I wish, oh, how I wish I could
            be a sailor!"</db:para>
        <db:para>At last his father, who was a wool comber, said to him, "My son, if you really wish to
            become a sailor, I will send you to a school where you will be taught navigation."</db:para>
        <db:para>Columbus was delighted at this, and told his father that he would study diligently. He
            was sent to the University of Pavia, where he learned all the geography that was then
            known, as well as how to draw maps and charts. He became a skillful penman, and also
            studied astronomy, geometry, and Latin.</db:para>
        <db:para>But he did not spend a long time at his studies, for at the age of fourteen he went to
            sea. What he had learned, however, gave him an excellent groundwork, and from this time
            forward he made use of every opportunity to inform himself and to become a scholarly
            man.</db:para>
        <db:para>His first voyage was made with a distant relative, who was an adventurous and daring
            man, and who was ever ready to fight with any one with whom he could pick a quarrel. In
            course of time Columbus commanded a ship of his own, and became known as a bold and
            daring navigator. He made a voyage along the coast of Africa as far south as Guinea, and
            afterwards sailed northward to Iceland.</db:para>
        <db:para>At an early day he became familiar with the wildest kind of adventure, for at this
            time sea life on the Mediterranean was little more than a series of fights with pirates.
            Some say that during one of these conflicts Columbus's ship caught fire. In order to
            save his life, he jumped into the water and swam six miles to shore, reaching the coast
            of Portugal. Others say that he was attracted to that country by the great school of
            navigation which Prince Henry had established. However that may be, he appeared at
            Lisbon at the age of thirty-five, filled with the idea of sailing westward to reach
            those rich Eastern countries in which every one was so much interested.</db:para>
        <db:para>He was laughed at for expressing such an idea. It is not pleasant to be laughed at,
            but Columbus was courageous and never wavered in his belief.</db:para>
        <db:para>"The earth is a sphere," he said; "those foolish stories of its being flat and
            supported on a turtle's back cannot be true."</db:para>
        <db:para>But those persons to whom he talked only laughed the more.</db:para>
        <db:para>"Is there anything more foolish," they asked, "than to believe that there are people
            who walk with their heels up and with their heads hanging down?" "Think of a place where
            the trees grow with their branches down, and where it snows, hails, and rains upward!"</db:para>
        <db:para>Everybody thought him an idle dreamer.</db:para>
        <db:para>Columbus tried to persuade King John to furnish him with ships and allow him to test
            his belief. But King John cruelly deceived Columbus; for, after obtaining his maps and
            charts, he sent off an expedition of his own. He hoped in this way to gain the glory of
            the discovery. The sailors whom he sent, however, were not brave enough to continue the
            voyage, and returned, frightened by a severe storm.</db:para>
        <db:para>Columbus was so disgusted by the treachery of King John that he made up his mind to
            leave Portugal and go to Spain. So, taking his little son, Diego, with him, he started
            on his journey. He traveled from place to place, trying to find some person who would
            help him make his ideas known to King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella. He thought that if
            he could talk with them he could persuade them to furnish him with ships.</db:para>
        <db:para>One day he came to a convent called La Rábida. Here Diego, who was weary and thirsty,
            begged his father to stop and ask for a drink of water. Columbus knocked at the big iron
            gate, and while he was conversing with the attendant a priest approached.</db:para>
        <db:para>This priest was attracted by the noble bearing and refined speech of Columbus, and saw
            at once that he was not a beggar. He asked him what he wished, and Columbus related his
            story.</db:para>
        <db:para>The good priest believed in him and said he would try to influence the king and queen
            to furnish him with ships. The priest brought the matter before the king; but at this
            time Spain was at war with the Moors, and King Ferdinand had no time to attend to
            anything else. Columbus was patient and waited. But as year after year passed and
            brought no prospect of obtaining the ships he wished, his hopes fell. After seven long,
            weary years of waiting, he was about to leave Spain in despair.</db:para>
        <db:para>Just as he was leaving, however, a message was brought to him from the queen, asking
            him to explain his plans to her once more. Columbus did so, and the queen was so fully
            convinced that she exclaimed: "I will provide ships and men for you, if I have to pledge
            my jewels in order to do so!"</db:para>
        <db:para>Three ships were fitted out for the voyage. These ships were very different from those
            we see to-day. They were light, frail barks called caravels, and two of them, the Pinta
            and Niña, had no decks. The third, the Santa Maria, had a deck. It was upon this largest
            caravel that Columbus placed his flag.</db:para>
        <db:para>On the 3d of August, 1492, the little fleet set sail from Palos, entering upon the
            most daring expedition ever undertaken by man. The people of the town gathered on the
            wharf to see the departure of the vessels. Many of them had friends or relatives on
            board whom they expected never to look upon again. Sad indeed was the sight as the
            little caravels sailed out of the harbor and faded from view.</db:para>
        <db:para>After sailing a few days, the Pinta broke her rudder. This accident the sailors took
            to be a sign of misfortune. They tried to persuade Columbus to put back to Palos, but he
            would not listen to such a suggestion. Instead of sailing back, he pushed on to the
            Canary Islands. Here his ships were delayed three weeks, after which they continued the
            voyage into unknown waters.</db:para>
        <db:para>After they had sailed westward for many days, the sailors began to show signs of
            alarm, and they implored Columbus to return. He tried to calm their fears. He described
            the rich lands he hoped to find, and reminded them of the wealth and fame this voyage
            would bring to them. So they agreed to venture a little farther.</db:para>
        <db:para>At last the compass began to point in a different direction, and the sailors became
            almost panic-stricken. They thought they were sailing straight to destruction, and when
            they found that Columbus would not listen to their entreaties they planned a mutiny.
            Though Columbus knew what the sailors were plotting, he kept steadily on his course.
            Fortunately, signs of land soon began to appear. A branch with berries on it floated
            past, a rudely carved paddle was picked up, and land birds were seen flying over the
            ships.</db:para>
        <db:para>A prize had been offered to the sailor who first saw land, and all eagerly watched for
            it night and day. At last, early one morning, a gun was fired from the Pinta, and all
            knew that land had been sighted. The sailors were filled with the wildest joy, and
            crowded around Columbus with expressions of gratitude and admiration, in great contrast
            to the distrustful manner in which they had treated him a few days before.</db:para>
        <db:para>The land they were approaching was very beautiful. It was a green, sunny island with
            pleasant groves in which birds were singing. Beautiful flowers were blooming all around
            and the trees were laden with fruit. The island was inhabited, too, for groups of
            strange-looking men were seen running to the shore.</db:para>
        <db:para>At length the ships cast anchor, the boats were lowered, and Columbus, clad in rich
            scarlet and carrying in his hand the royal banner of Spain, was taken ashore. As soon as
            he stepped on the beach, Columbus knelt down and gave thanks to God. He then planted the
            banner of Spain in the ground and took possession of the country in the name of
            Ferdinand and Isabella.</db:para>
        <db:para>This island he called San Salvador, because he and his crew had been saved from a
            watery grave, and also because October 12 was so named in the Spanish calendar.</db:para>
        <db:para>Columbus supposed San Salvador to be one of the islands near the coast of Asia, but it
            is one of the Bahamas.</db:para>
        <db:para>Thus was America discovered on the 12th of October, 1492.</db:para>
        <db:para>The natives of this island were different from any people the Spaniards had ever seen.
            They were of a reddish-brown color, and had high cheek bones, small black eyes, and
            straight black hair. They were entirely naked, and their bodies were greased and
            painted. Their hair was decorated with feathers, and many of them were adorned with
            curious ornaments.</db:para>
        <db:para>They were at first very much afraid of the white men and kept far away. But gradually
            they lost their fear and brought the Spaniards presents of bananas and oranges. Some of
            them gathered courage enough to touch the Spaniards and pass their hands over them, as
            if to make certain that they were real beings. These men, whose skin was so white, they
            thought to be gods who had come down from the sky.</db:para>
        <db:para>When Columbus asked them where they found the gold of which many of their ornaments
            were made, they pointed toward the south. Then Columbus took some of them with him to
            search for the land of gold.</db:para>
        <db:para>The next land he reached was the island of Cuba. Thinking that this was a part of
            India, he called the natives Indians. He then sailed to Haiti, which he called
            Hispaniola, or "Little Spain." For more than three months Columbus cruised among these
            islands, where the air was always balmy, the sky clear, and the land beautiful. The
            sailors believed these new lands were Paradise, and wanted to live there always.</db:para>
        <db:para>At length, however, they thought of returning to their home and friends. So, taking
            several Indians with them, and many curious baskets and ornaments, they set out on their
            return voyage.</db:para>
        <db:para>This voyage proved to be very stormy, and at one time it seemed certain that the ships
            would go down; but after a time the sea grew quiet, and on the 15th of March they sailed
            again into the little harbor of Palos.</db:para>
        <db:para>You can imagine the excitement.</db:para>
        <db:para>"What! has Columbus returned?" asked the people. "Has he really found the East by
            sailing westward?"</db:para>
        <db:para>"Yes, he has," was the answer. "He has found India."</db:para>
        <db:para>Columbus was given a royal welcome. The king and queen held a great celebration in his
            honor at Barcelona; and when the Indians marched into court the astonishment of every
            person was great. The Indians were half naked; their dark bodies were painted, and their
            heads were adorned with feathers. They carried baskets of seed pearls, and wore strange
            ornaments of gold. Some carried the skins of wild animals, and others carried beautiful
            birds of brilliant plumage. Every inhabitant of Barcelona rejoiced, and the bells were
            rung in honor of the great discoverer.</db:para>
        <db:para>It was a happy time for Columbus. He felt repaid for all his suffering and trouble.</db:para>
        <db:para>King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella now wished Columbus to go again to these newly
            discovered islands and search for the gold that was thought to be there. You may be sure
            Columbus was willing to go. So they fitted out seventeen vessels, manned by fifteen
            hundred men, and placed Columbus in command of this fleet. It was no trouble to find men
            who were willing to go on this voyage. All wanted to see the new world that had been
            found.</db:para>
        <db:para>During this second voyage, which was made in 1493, Columbus discovered Jamaica, Puerto
            Rico, and some small islands in the Caribbean Sea.</db:para>
        <db:para>On the island of Jamaica the Spaniards came upon the footprints of some strange animal
            which they thought to be a dragon. This dragon they believed was guarding the gold which
            they supposed was on the island. So they ran back to their ships in fear. Later on they
            became used to seeing these footprints, and found that they were those of alligators. At
            Puerto Rico they suffered from a savage attack made by the natives, who shot poisoned
            arrows and threw javelins at them. But in most other places the natives were very
            friendly.</db:para>
        <db:para>Columbus thought this land was a part of the east coast of Asia, and he could not
            understand why he did not find cities such as Marco Polo had described.</db:para>
        <db:para>Columbus then sailed to Hispaniola, where he planted a colony, of which he was made
            governor. It was not an easy matter to govern this island, because of the jealousies and
            quarrels of the Spaniards. At length Columbus returned to Spain, ill and discouraged.</db:para>
        <db:para>Columbus made a third voyage in 1498, during which he sailed along the coast of
            Brazil, and discovered Trinidad Island. Here his ships encountered currents of fresh
            water which flowed with great force into the ocean. This led Columbus to think that so
            large a river must flow across a great continent, and strengthened his opinion that the
            land was a part of the great continent of Asia.</db:para>
        <db:para>After sailing farther north along the Pearl Coast, which was so called because of the
            pearls found there, he returned to Hispaniola. Here he found the Spaniards engaged in an
            Indian war, and quarreling among themselves. Some officials became jealous of him, bound
            him with chains, and sent him back to Spain a prisoner. Ferdinand and Isabella were much
            displeased at this treatment of Columbus, and set him free.</db:para>
        <db:para>A fourth voyage was made by Columbus in 1502, during which he explored the coast of
            Honduras in search of a strait leading to the Indian Ocean. In this venture he was
            unsuccessful. On his return to Spain he found his friend Queen Isabella very ill, and
            nineteen days after his arrival she died.</db:para>
        <db:para>After Isabella's death the king treated Columbus cruelly and ungratefully. The people
            had become jealous of him, and his last days were spent in poverty and distress. He
            never knew that he had discovered a new continent, but supposed that he had found India.</db:para>
        <db:para>Seven years after his death the king repented of his ingratitude, and caused the
            remains of Columbus to be removed from the little monastery in Valladolid to a monastery
            in Seville, where a magnificent monument was erected to his memory. In 1536 his bones
            were removed to the Cathedral of San Domingo in Hispaniola, and later they were taken to
            the cathedral in Havana.</db:para>
        <db:para>When the United States took possession of Cuba, the Spanish disinterred the bones of
            Columbus again and carried them to Spain, placing them in the cathedral of Seville,
            where they now are.</db:para>

        <db:title>VASCO DA GAMA</db:title>
        <db:para>Both the Spaniards and the Portuguese were cut off from trade with the East, because
            the Turks had taken possession of Constantinople. In consequence of this, the navigators
            of both countries were making earnest efforts to find a water route to India.</db:para>
        <db:para>Spain, as you know, had faith in Columbus, and helped him in his plan of trying to
            reach India by sailing westward. But the Portuguese had a different idea. They spent
            their time and money in trying to sail round the African coast, in the belief that India
            could be reached by means of a southeast passage.</db:para>
        <db:para>This southeast passage could be found only by crossing the "burning zone," as the part
            of the earth near the equator was called; and all sailors feared to make the attempt.</db:para>
        <db:para>It was thought almost impossible to cross this burning zone, and the few navigators
            who had ventured as far as the equator had turned back in fear of steaming whirlpools
            and of fiery belts of heat.</db:para>
        <db:para>In 1486, six years before Columbus discovered America, the King of Portugal sent
            Bartholomew Diaz, a bold and daring navigator, to find the end of the African coast.</db:para>
        <db:para>Bartholomew Diaz sailed through the fiery zone without meeting any of the dreadful
            misfortunes which the sailors so feared. When he had sailed beyond the tropic of
            Capricorn, a severe storm arose. The wind blew his three vessels directly south for
            thirteen days, during which time he lost sight of land. When the sun shone again, Diaz
            headed his vessels eastward, but as no land appeared, he again changed the direction,
            this time heading them toward the north. After sailing northward a short time, land was
            reached about two hundred miles east of the Cape of Good Hope.</db:para>
        <db:para>Diaz now pushed on four hundred miles farther along the coast of Africa, and saw the
            wide expanse of the Indian Ocean before him. Here the sailors refused to go any farther,
            and Diaz, although he wanted very much to go ahead and try to reach India, was obliged
            to return.</db:para>
        <db:para>On the way home, the vessels passed close to the cape which projects from the south
            coast of Africa, and Diaz named it Stormy Cape, in memory of the frightful storm which
            hid it from view on the way down. When they reached Lisbon, however, King John said that
            it should be called the Cape of Good Hope, because they now had hope that the southern
            route to India was found.</db:para>
        <db:para>Diaz won much praise for his bravery and patience in making this voyage. He had proved
            that the stories about the fiery zone were false, and that the African coast had an end.</db:para>
        <db:para>It remained, however, for Vasco da Gama, then a young man of about twenty years of
            age, to prove that India could be reached in this way.</db:para>
        <db:para>In 1497 Da Gama sailed from Lisbon to the Cape of Good Hope, doubled the cape, and
            proceeded across the Indian Ocean to Hindustan.</db:para>
        <db:para>He returned to Lisbon in 1499, his ships loaded with the rich products of the East,
            including cloves, spices, pepper, ginger, and nutmeg. He also brought with him rich
            robes of silk and satin, costly gems, and many articles made of carved ivory, or of gold
            and of silver.</db:para>
        <db:para>The King of Portugal was greatly pleased with what Da Gama had accomplished, and his
            successful voyage was the wonder of the day.</db:para>
        <db:para>The same year that Da Gama returned from India by a route around the south end of
            Africa, with his ships loaded with rich produce, Sebastian Cabot returned from a
            fruitless voyage to the strange, barren coast of North America.</db:para>
        <db:para>It was no wonder that the voyages of Columbus and the Cabots were thought unsuccessful
            as compared with the voyage Da Gama had just finished.</db:para>
        <db:para>No one then dreamed of a New World; all were searching for the Orient—for golden
            Cathay.</db:para>

        <db:title>JOHN AND SEBASTIAN CABOT'S VOYAGES</db:title>
        <db:para>John Cabot was a Venetian merchant, and a bold seafaring man. For purposes of trade he
            had taken up his home in Bristol, England. Bristol at that time was the most important
            seaport of England, and carried on a large fishing trade with Iceland.</db:para>
        <db:para>When the news of the voyage of Columbus reached Bristol, Cabot begged the English
            king, Henry VII., to let him go and see if he could find a shorter route to the Indies.
            The king gave his consent, and told Cabot to take possession of any land he might
            discover for England.</db:para>
        <db:para>Cabot fitted out his vessel and, taking his son Sebastian and a crew of eighteen men
            with him, set sail in 1497. He headed his ship westward, hoping to reach the Spice
            Islands and that part of Asia which was so rich in gold, and which Columbus had failed
            to find. At last, one sunny morning in June, land was sighted in the distance.</db:para>
        <db:para>This land, which was probably a part of Nova Scotia, proved to be a lonely shore with
            dense forests. Cabot called it "Land First Seen." It was entirely deserted, not a human
            being nor a hut of any kind being in sight.</db:para>
        <db:para>Here Cabot and his son Sebastian and some of his crew went ashore, and were the first
            white men, excepting the Norsemen, to step upon the mainland of America. Up to this
            time, Columbus had discovered only islands of the West Indies. A year later than this he
            discovered the continent of South America. Cabot and his companions erected a large
            cross on the shore, and planted two flagpoles in the ground, from which they unfurled
            the English and Venetian flags. Then they returned to their ships, and, after sailing
            about the Gulf of St. Lawrence, went back to England.</db:para>
        <db:para>King Henry and the people received John Cabot with great honor. Everybody thought that
            Cabot had reached Asia, and he also believed that he had. He was called the "Great
            Admiral," and the people of Bristol ran after him on the street, shouting his name and
            trying in every way to show him how much they admired and honored him. The king gave him
            fifty dollars in money, which seems to us in these days a small sum for so long and
            dangerous a voyage. Besides this, the king urged him to undertake another voyage.</db:para>
        <db:para>About a year later Sebastian Cabot made the second voyage, and this time the gloomy
            shore of Labrador was reached.</db:para>
        <db:para>Sebastian on his voyage sailed far north, passing many icebergs, and seeing many
            strange and wonderful sights.</db:para>
        <db:para>On great blocks of ice that floated past the ship he saw immense white bears. These
            bears were fine swimmers, and would often leap into the water and bring out fish, which
            they would devour greedily. The waters were filled with fish, and, as the ship neared
            the shore, they grew so numerous as almost to retard the sailing of the vessel.</db:para>
        <db:para>"Now," said Cabot, "the English will not have to go to Iceland any more for fish."</db:para>
        <db:para>But Cabot knew that the lands he was seeking were warm lands. So he turned his vessel
            south, hoping to reach some opening which would lead to them. To his great surprise, he
            found the coast very long and without any opening, and he sailed on and on as far as
            Maryland, taking possession of the land for England.</db:para>
        <db:para>At places along this shore were seen Indians, clad in skins and furs of wild animals,
            fishing from little canoes. Stags much larger than any in England were seen in great
            numbers, and wild turkeys and game of all sorts abounded.</db:para>
        <db:para>Then Sebastian Cabot began to think that this was a part of Asia never known before,
            and he set sail for home to tell the wonderful news.</db:para>
        <db:para>When he reached Bristol he found everybody still interested in India. It was a water
            route to India that was wanted, and not a new country. People cared more about reaching
            golden Cathay than about finding new, barren lands.</db:para>
        <db:para>So, although King Henry was proud to know that the new land belonged to England, it
            was eleven years before he made any further attempt to send ships there to take
            possession.</db:para>

        <db:title>AMERIGO VESPUCCI</db:title>
        <db:para>Amerigo Vespucci was a native of Florence, Italy, and a friend of Columbus. He was an
            educated man and very fond of study.</db:para>
        <db:para>At the time in which he lived it was difficult to find the latitude and longitude of
            places, and few people were able to calculate either correctly. Vespucci was skillful in
            the work of computing longitude, and he was also well versed in the history of all the
            voyages that had been made. He was familiar with the facts of astronomy and geography
            then known, and was well able to conduct the sailing of a ship into strange waters.</db:para>
        <db:para>It is believed that Vespucci made six voyages. He did not command his own vessels, as
            Columbus did, but he went with the expedition as assistant or adviser to the captain,
            keeping records of the voyage and making maps and charts.</db:para>
        <db:para>In his first voyage, made in 1497, Vespucci reached the coast of Honduras, and sailed
            into the Gulf of Mexico. Here he found, probably on the coast of Yucatan, a queer little
            sea village which reminded him of the great city of Venice near his home.</db:para>
        <db:para>The houses in this village were made of wood, and were built on piles running out into
            the water. These houses were connected with the shore by bridges, which were constructed
            in such a manner that they could be drawn up, thus cutting off all connection with the
            land. In one house Vespucci found six hundred people. A very large family, was it not?</db:para>
        <db:para>Continuing the voyage around the Gulf of Mexico, Vespucci saw many strange and
            wonderful things. The natives roasted and ate frightful animals, which from the
            description given us we now know to have been alligators. They also made cakes, or
            patties, out of fish, and baked them on red-hot coals. The Spaniards were invited to
            taste these dainties, and those of the sailors who did so found the strange food very
            palatable.</db:para>
        <db:para>After sailing round the coast of Florida, the ships headed northeast, landing every
            now and then for the purpose of trading with the Indians. The Spaniards, finding but
            little gold and none of the rich spices for which they were looking, at last decided to
            return home.</db:para>
        <db:para>Just before sailing, some friendly Indians helped the Spaniards to make an attack upon
            a cannibal island. The attack was successful, and about two hundred cannibals were taken
            prisoners and carried to Spain, where they were sold as slaves.</db:para>
        <db:para>Vespucci made a second voyage in 1499, in which he sailed down the African coast to
            the Cape Verde Islands, and then headed his ship almost directly west. He sighted land
            at Cape St. Roque, and then sailed northwest, exploring the north coast of South
            America, then called the Pearl Coast. After this he returned to Spain.</db:para>
        <db:para>Shortly after the return of Vespucci to Spain, he accepted an offer to take service
            under the Portuguese flag.</db:para>
        <db:para>In 1501 he set sail from Lisbon with three caravels, under this flag. He reached the
            coast of South America near Cape St. Roque, and sailed south as far as the South Georgia
            Islands.</db:para>
        <db:para>As he proceeded southward, he found the country was inhabited by fierce Indians, who
            ate their fellow-creatures. He did not like the natives, as you may suppose; but he
            thought the country was beautiful, with the wonderful verdure and foliage of the
            tropics, and the queer animals and bright-colored birds.</db:para>
        <db:para>Great was the joy of Vespucci when he discovered in the forests large quantities of a
            sort of red dyewood which was prized very highly by Europeans. This wood, which had
            hitherto been found only in Eastern countries, was called brazil wood; and because of
            its abundance there, he gave the name Brazil to that part of the country.</db:para>
        <db:para>The expedition sailed slowly on and at length lost sight of land. It is thought that
            Vespucci headed the ships southeast because he wished to find out whether there was land
            or not in the Antarctic Ocean.</db:para>
        <db:para>As they sailed farther and farther south, the climate became very disagreeable. The
            winds grew cold and forbidding, fields of floating ice hindered the progress of the
            vessel, and the nights became very long.</db:para>
        <db:para>The sailors grew frightened, fearing that they were entering a land of constant
            darkness. Their fear became greater when a terrific storm arose. The sea grew rough, and
            the fog and sleet prevented the sailors from seeing whether land was near or not. The
            land which they had hoped to find now became an added danger.</db:para>
        <db:para>One day, through the sleet and snow, the sailors saw with terror a rocky, jagged coast
            in front of them.</db:para>
        <db:para>This land proved to be the South Georgia Islands, and was a wretched and forlorn
            country composed of rocks and glaciers, and entirely deserted. For a day and a half they
            sailed in sight of this frightful shore, fearing each moment that their ship would be
            cast on the rocks and that they would all perish. As soon as the weather permitted,
            therefore, Vespucci signaled his fleet, and the ships were headed for home, reaching
            Portugal in 1502.</db:para>
        <db:para>This voyage secured Brazil for Portugal, and added greatly to the geographical
            knowledge of the day.</db:para>
        <db:para>The ancients had said that no continent existed south of the equator. But the great
            length of coast along which Vespucci had sailed proved that the land was not an island.
            It was plainly a continent, and south of the equator.</db:para>
        <db:para>Vespucci called the land he found the New World. For a time it was also called the
            Fourth Part of the Earth, the other three parts being Europe, Asia, and Africa. In 1507
            a German writer published an account of the discovery, in which he called the new
            country America, in honor of Americus Vespucius,1 the discoverer.</db:para>
        <db:para>This land was not connected in any way with the discovery of Columbus, for he was
            supposed to have found Asia.</db:para>
        <db:para>The name America was at first applied only to that part of the country which we now
            call Brazil, but little by little the name was extended until it included the whole of
            the Western Continent.</db:para>
        <db:para>You will be glad to know that Vespucci, in the time of his success, did not forget his
            old friend Columbus, who was then poor and in disgrace. Vespucci visited him and did all
            he could to assist him.</db:para>
        <db:para>After Vespucci had made three other voyages to the New World, he was given an
            important government position in Spain, which he held during the remainder of his
        life.</db:para>

        <db:title>PONCE DE LEON</db:title>
        <db:para>You have heard many surprising things which the people of the fifteenth century
            believed. It seems almost impossible for us to think that those people really had faith
            in a Fountain of Youth; yet such is the case.</db:para>
        <db:para>This fountain was supposed to exist somewhere in the New World, and it was thought
            that if any one should bathe in its waters, he would become young and would never grow
            old again.</db:para>
        <db:para>In 1513 Ponce de Leon, who was then governor of Puerto Rico, sailed from that island
            in search of this Fountain of Youth. De Leon was an old man, and he felt that his life
            was nearly over, unless he should succeed in finding this fountain. At the same time De
            Leon wished to gain gold, for, though he had already made a fortune in Puerto Rico, he
            was still very greedy.</db:para>
        <db:para>The expedition under his guidance sailed among the Bahamas and other islands near
            them, and at length reached a land beautiful with flowers, balmy with warm breezes, and
            cheerful with the song of birds. Partly because this discovery was made on Easter
            Sunday, which the Spaniards called Pascua Florida, and partly because of the abundance
            of flowers, De Leon called the land Florida.</db:para>
        <db:para>He took possession of this delightful country for Spain, and then spent many weeks
            exploring its coast. After sailing north as far as St. Augustine, and finding neither
            gold nor the fabled Fountain of Youth, De Leon turned his vessels and proceeded south,
            doubling the Florida Cape. Shortly afterwards he became discouraged and returned to
            Puerto Rico.</db:para>
        <db:para>In 1521 De Leon went again to Florida, this time for the purpose of planting a colony.
            The Indians were very angry that the white men should try to take their land, and they
            made a fierce attack upon De Leon and his party. In this attack De Leon received a
            severe wound, which compelled him to go to Cuba for care and rest. There he died after
            much suffering.</db:para>
        <db:para>De Leon never found the Fountain of Youth, nor were the fabled waters discovered
            afterwards.</db:para>

        <db:title>BALBOA</db:title>
        <db:para>The Spanish colonists on the island of Hispaniola made frequent visits to the
            mainland, searching for the rich cities of which Marco Polo had written.</db:para>
        <db:para>Word reached the colonists that some of these gold hunters were starving at a place
            called Darien, and a ship was immediately sent to their relief. The cargo of the ship
            consisted of barrels of provisions and ammunition.</db:para>
        <db:para>Imagine, if you can, the amazement of the commander of the expedition when, after his
            ships were under sail, a young and handsome man stepped out of one of the barrels. The
            young man was Vasco Nuñez Balboa. He had chosen this way to escape from Cuba, where he
            owed large sums of money which he could not pay. The commander was angry, and threatened
            to leave Balboa on a desert island; but at length he took pity on the young man, and
            allowed him to remain on board the ship.</db:para>
        <db:para>When the mainland was reached, the Spaniards who were already there, having heard of
            the cruelty of the commander, refused to let him land. He therefore put off to sea, and
            was never heard of again. Balboa then took command of the men and began immediately to
            explore the country.</db:para>
        <db:para>He made a friendly alliance with an Indian chief, who presented him with gold and
            slaves. The Spaniards were delighted at the sight of so much riches. They began to melt
            and weigh the gold, and at last fell to quarreling desperately about the division of it.</db:para>
        <db:para>This the Indians could not understand. They knew nothing of money, and valued the
            metal only because it could be made into beautiful ornaments.</db:para>
        <db:para>An Indian boy who had heard the dispute told the Spaniards that if they cared so much
            about that yellow stuff, it would be wise for them to go to a country where there was
            enough of it for all.</db:para>
        <db:para>The Spaniards eagerly questioned him regarding this place. The boy then described a
            country across the mountains and to the south, on the shores of a great sea, where the
            metal was so plentiful that the natives used it for their ordinary drinking cups and
            bowls.</db:para>
        <db:para>Balboa immediately started southward across the mountains in search of this rich
            country. On his way he came upon a tribe of hostile Indians, who attacked him, but who
            fled in alarm from the guns of the Spaniards.</db:para>
        <db:para>Taking some Indians as guides, Balboa pushed on through the mountains, and on
            September 25, 1513, from one of the highest peaks, looked down upon the Pacific Ocean.</db:para>
        <db:para>With his Spaniards he descended the mountain, and in four days reached the shore of
            that magnificent body of water. Balboa waded out into it with his sword in his hand, and
            formally took possession of it for the King of Spain. He called it the South Sea,
            because he was looking toward the south when he first saw it; and the Pacific Ocean was
            known by this name for many years afterward.</db:para>
        <db:para>On this shore he met an Indian who repeated to him the same story that the Indian boy
            had told about the rich country on the border of this sea and farther to the south.</db:para>
        <db:para>Balboa then made up his mind to find this country. Accordingly he returned to Darien,
            and sent word to the Spanish king of his great discovery of the South Sea.</db:para>
        <db:para>He then began to take his ships apart, and to send them, piece by piece, across the
            mountains to the Pacific coast.</db:para>
        <db:para>This was an enormous undertaking. The journey was a very difficult one, and hundreds
            of the poor Indians who carried the burdens dropped dead from exhaustion.</db:para>
        <db:para>At length, after long months of labor, four ships were thus carried across the
            mountains and rebuilt on the Pacific coast. These were the first European vessels ever
            launched on the great South Sea. Three hundred men were in readiness to go with Balboa
            on his voyage in search of the rich country of the South.</db:para>
        <db:para>A little iron and a little pitch were still needed for the ships, and Balboa delayed
            his departure in order to get these articles.</db:para>
        <db:para>The delay gave his enemies, who were jealous because of his success, time to carry out
            a plot against him. They accused him of plotting to set up an independent government of
            his own, and caused him to be arrested for treason. In less than twenty-four hours this
            brave and high-spirited leader was tried, found guilty, and beheaded. So ended all his
            ambitious plans.</db:para>

        <db:title>MAGELLAN</db:title>
        <db:para>One of the boldest and most determined of all the early explorers was Ferdinand
            Magellan, a young Portuguese nobleman. He felt sure that somewhere on that long coast
            which so many explorers had reached he would find a strait through which he would be
            able to pass, and which would lead into the Indian Ocean; and so Magellan formed the
            idea of circumnavigating the globe.</db:para>
        <db:para>He applied to the King of Portugal for aid; but as the Portuguese king was not willing
            to help him, he went to Spain, where his plan found favor.</db:para>
        <db:para>The Spanish king gave him a fleet of five vessels, and on September 20, 1519, he set
            sail for the Canary Islands. Continuing the voyage toward Sierra Leone, the vessels were
            becalmed, and for a period of three weeks they advanced only nine miles. Then a terrific
            storm arose, and the sailors, who had grumbled and found fault with everything during
            the entire voyage, broke into open mutiny. This mutiny Magellan quickly quelled by
            causing the principal offender to be arrested and put in irons.</db:para>
        <db:para>The voyage was then continued, and land was at last sighted on the Brazilian coast,
            near Pernambuco.</db:para>
        <db:para>The fleet then proceeded down the coast as far as Patagonia, where the weather grew so
            very cold that it was decided to seek winter quarters and postpone the remainder of the
            journey until spring. This was done, Magellan finding a sheltered spot at Port St.
            Julian, where plenty of fish could be obtained and where the natives were friendly.</db:para>
        <db:para>These native Patagonians Magellan described as being very tall, like giants, with
            long, flowing hair, and dressed scantily in skins.</db:para>
        <db:para>Great hardships had been endured by the crew. Food and water had been scarce, the
            storms had been severe, and suffering from cold was intense. The sailors did not believe
            there was any strait, and they begged Magellan to sail for home. It was useless to try
            to influence this determined man. Danger made him only the more firm. Magellan told them
            that he would not return until he had found the opening for which he was looking.</db:para>
        <db:para>Then the mutiny broke out anew. But Magellan by his prompt and decisive action put it
            down in twenty-four hours. One offender was killed, and two others were put in irons and
            left to their fate on the shore when the ships sailed away.</db:para>
        <db:para>As soon as the weather grew warmer the ships started again southward. After nearly two
            months of sailing, most of the time through violent storms, a narrow channel was found,
            in which the water was salt. This the sailors knew must be the entrance to a strait.</db:para>
        <db:para>Food was scarce, and the men again begged Magellan to return; but he firmly refused,
            saying: "I will go on, if I have to eat the leather off the ship's yards."</db:para>
        <db:para>So the ships entered and sailed through the winding passage, which sometimes broadened
            out into a bay and then became narrow again. Among the twists and windings of this
            perilous strait, one of the vessels, being in charge of a mutinous commander, escaped
            and turned back.</db:para>
        <db:para>On both sides of the shore there were high mountains, the tops of which were covered
            with snow, and which cast gloomy shadows upon the water below them.</db:para>
        <db:para>Think of the feelings of the crew when, after sailing five weeks through this winding
            channel, they came out into a calm expanse of water. Magellan was overcome by the sight,
            and shed tears of joy. He named the vast waters before him Pacific, which means
            "peaceful," because of their contrast to the violent and stormy Atlantic.</db:para>
        <db:para>The fleet now sailed northwest into a warmer climate and over a tranquil ocean, and as
            week after week passed and no land was seen, the sailors lost all hope. They began to
            think that this ocean had no end, and that they might sail on and on forever.</db:para>
        <db:para>These poor men suffered very much from lack of food and water, and many died of
            famine. The boastful remark of Magellan was recalled when the sailors did really begin
            to eat the leather from the ship's yards, first soaking it in the water.</db:para>
        <db:para>Anxiously these worn and haggard men looked about for signs of land, and at length
            they were rewarded. The Ladrone Islands were reached, and supplies of fresh vegetables,
            meats, and fruits were obtained. From the Isles de Ladrones, or "Isles of Robbers," the
            fleet proceeded to the Philippines.</db:para>
        <db:para>Here Magellan knew that he was near the Indian Ocean, and realized that if he kept on
            in his course he would circumnavigate the globe.</db:para>
        <db:para>It was on one of the Philippine Islands that this "Prince of Navigators" lost his life
            in a skirmish with the natives. He was, as usual, in the thickest of the fight, and
            while trying to shield one of his men was struck down by the spear of a native.</db:para>
        <db:para>One of his ships, the Victoria, continued the voyage around Cape of Good Hope, and on
            September 6, 1522, with eighteen weary and half-starved men on board, succeeded in
            reaching Spain.</db:para>
        <db:para>Great hardships had been endured, but the wonderful news they brought made up in some
            measure for their suffering.</db:para>
        <db:para>This was the greatest voyage since the first voyage of Columbus, and the strait still
            bears the name of the remarkable man whose courage and strength of purpose led to the
            accomplishment of one of the greatest undertakings ever recorded in history.</db:para>
        <db:para>This wonderful voyage of Magellan's proved beyond doubt that the earth is round. It
            also proved that South America is a continent, and that there is no short southwest
            passage.</db:para>
        <db:para>After this voyage all the navigators turned their attention to the discovery of a
            northwest passage.</db:para>

        <db:title>HERNANDO CORTES</db:title>
        <db:para>The Spaniards who lived on the island of Hispaniola sent frequent expeditions to the
            mainland in the hope of finding gold.</db:para>
        <db:para>Hernando Cortes, a dashing young Spaniard with a love of adventure and a reckless
            daring seldom seen, was given command of one of these expeditions.</db:para>
        <db:para>In March, 1519, he landed on the coast of Central America, with about six hundred men,
            ten heavy guns, and sixteen horses. Here Cortes found the natives in large numbers
            arrayed against him. A fierce battle was fought. But the firearms of the Spaniards
            frightened the barbarians, and when the cavalry arrived the Indians fled in terror. The
            Indians, who had never seen horses before, thought the man riding the horse was a part
            of the animal, and that these strange creatures were sent by the gods. Fear made the
            Indians helpless, and it was easy for Cortes to gain a victory over them.</db:para>
        <db:para>After this victory Cortes sailed northward along the coast of San Juan de Ulloa. The
            natives of that region had heard of the wonderful white-skinned and bearded men who bore
            charmed lives, and they thought that these men were gods. They, therefore, treated the
            Spaniards in a friendly manner, and brought gifts of flowers, fruits, and vegetables,
            and also ornaments of gold and silver to Cortes.</db:para>
        <db:para>Here Cortes landed and founded the city of Vera Cruz, which is to-day an important
            seaport of Mexico. The native Indians in this place were called Aztecs. Some of their
            chiefs, who paid a visit to Cortes, told him of the great Emperor Montezuma, who was
            rich and powerful, and who lived inland, in a wonderful city built in a lake.</db:para>
        <db:para>By these chiefs Cortes sent to Montezuma presents of collars, bracelets, and ornaments
            of glass, an armchair richly carved, and an embroidered crimson cap. In return,
            Montezuma sent shields, helmets, and plates of pure gold, sandals, fans, gold ornaments
            of exquisite workmanship, together with robes of fine cotton interwoven with feather
            work, so skillfully done that it resembled painting. The cap which Cortes had sent was
            returned filled with gold dust.</db:para>
        <db:para>The great Montezuma also sent a message to Cortes, saying that he would be glad to
            meet so brave a general, but that the road to the Mexican capital was too dangerous for
            an army to pass over. He also promised to pay a yearly tribute to the Spanish king if
            Cortes and his followers would depart and leave him in peace.</db:para>
        <db:para>The Spaniards were jubilant when they saw the superb gifts. They felt certain that
            this great emperor must have enormous wealth at his command, and in spite of the warning
            message, most of them wished to start immediately for the Mexican capital. Some,
            however, thought such a course very unwise; Montezuma, they said, was so powerful a
            ruler that it was absurd to attack him with their small force, and they advised
            returning to Cuba for a large number of soldiers.</db:para>
        <db:para>But Cortes had his own ideas on the subject. So he secretly ordered his ships to be
            sunk, and then, all chance of retreat being cut off, the entire force proceeded toward
            Mexico, August 16, 1519.</db:para>
        <db:para>After a long march, the Spaniards began to ascend the plateau on which the city of
            Mexico is situated, and finally reached the top of it, seven thousand feet high.</db:para>
        <db:para>They found the climate on this plateau temperate and balmy. The fields were
            cultivated, and beautiful flowers grew wild in profusion.</db:para>
        <db:para>During the march the Spaniards passed many towns containing queer houses and temples.
            They entered many of the temples, threw down the idols, and took possession of ornaments
            of value. At length they saw in the distance a city which was built in a salt lake.
            Three avenues, built of stone, led across the water to it.</db:para>
        <db:para>These avenues, which were four or five miles in length, were guarded on both sides by
            Indians in canoes. The avenues continued through the city, meeting in the center, where
            the great temple was situated.</db:para>
        <db:para>The temple was inclosed by a huge stone wall, and contained twenty pyramids, each a
            hundred feet in height. Nearly all of the houses were two stories high, and were built
            of red stone. The roofs were flat, with towers at the corners, and on top of the roofs
            there were beautiful flower gardens.</db:para>
        <db:para>Into this remarkable town Cortes and his followers marched. Montezuma received his
            unwelcome guests with every mark of friendship, and with much pomp and ceremony. The
            great emperor was carried on a litter, which was richly decorated with gold and silver.
            The nobles of his court surrounded him, and hundreds of his retainers were drawn up in
            line behind him.</db:para>
        <db:para>The first thing, when Cortes and Montezuma met, was the customary exchange of
            presents. Cortes presented Montezuma with a chain of colored glass beads, and in return
            the Aztec ruler gave Cortes a house which was large enough to accommodate all of the
            Spaniards.</db:para>
        <db:para>For ten days these two men met each other and exchanged civilities, Cortes pretending
            to be paying a friendly visit, and Montezuma feeling puzzled and uncertain.</db:para>
        <db:para>At length Cortes induced Montezuma to go to the house where the Spaniards were living,
            and then, when he got him there, refused to allow him to leave, thus keeping him a
            prisoner in his own city.</db:para>
        <db:para>This daring act aroused the suspicions of the Aztecs. But Cortes used all his cunning
            to deceive these simple-hearted people and to make them continue to think that the
            Spaniards were gods. Still, the Aztecs were beginning to feel very bitter toward Cortes
            and his followers because of the disrespect with which they treated the Aztec temples
            and gods. The Spaniards were constantly throwing these gods out of the temples. Even
            their great god of war was not safe.</db:para>
        <db:para>Cortes openly derided this image, calling it trash, and proposing to erect the emblems
            of the Spanish religion in its place in the Aztec temples.</db:para>
        <db:para>Now, the Aztec god of war was a frightful image with golden serpents entwined about
            the body. The face was hideous, and in its hand was carried a plate upon which were
            placed human hearts as sacrifices. But to the Aztecs the image was sacred, and this
            insult, together with many others which had been offered their gods, made the natives
            very angry.</db:para>
        <db:para>One day the Aztecs discovered that some of the Spaniards had died. This knowledge
            dispelled the fear that their unbidden visitors were gods, and they attacked the
            Spaniards with great fury.</db:para>
        <db:para>The Aztec warriors wore quilted cotton doublets and headdresses adorned with feathers.
            They carried leather shields, and fought fiercely with bows and arrows, copper-pointed
            lances, javelins, and slings. Though by comparison few in numbers, the Spaniards, who
            were protected by coats of mail, made great havoc with their guns and horses.</db:para>
        <db:para>The battle between these unequal forces raged with great fury, and for a time the
            result was uncertain. Cortes compelled Montezuma, his prisoner, to show himself on the
            roof of his house and try to persuade the Aztecs to stop fighting.</db:para>
        <db:para>The Indians, however, no longer feared their emperor, and instead of obeying him, they
            made him a target for their arrows and stones. In the midst of the fight, the great
            Montezuma was finally knocked down and killed by one of his former subjects.</db:para>
        <db:para>After a desperate struggle, the Spaniards were forced to retreat. While making their
            escape over the bridges of the city they were attacked by Indian warriors in canoes, and
            more than half of their number were killed.</db:para>
        <db:para>Notwithstanding this defeat and the loss of so many men, Cortes did not give up his
            design of conquering Mexico. He made an alliance with hostile tribes of Indians, and
            again attacked the city.</db:para>
        <db:para>The Aztecs had now a new king, named Gua-te-mot-zin, who was as brave and determined
            as Cortes himself. Guatemotzin made preparations to oppose Cortes, and during the
            terrible siege which followed never once thought of surrendering or of asking for peace.</db:para>
        <db:para>The Spaniards made attack after attack, and terrible battles were fought, in which the
            loss on both sides was very great. During one of these battles Cortes was nearly
            captured, and it seemed as though the war god was to be avenged upon the man who had so
            insulted him. But a young Spaniard rushed to the assistance of Cortes, and with one blow
            of his sword cut off the arms of the Indian who had dared to seize the Spanish leader.</db:para>
        <db:para>After a time the Aztecs found themselves prisoners within their own city. The
            Spaniards had cut off all means of escape, and the Indians were starving to death. Their
            sufferings were terrible, and hundreds dropped down daily in the streets. Yet the proud
            king Guatemotzin refused to submit, and Cortes ordered a final attack. After furious
            fighting Guatemotzin was captured, and the Aztecs surrendered. Their cruel religion,
            with its strange gods and human sacrifices, was now overthrown.</db:para>
        <db:para>Cortes, with his few followers, never more than one thousand trained soldiers, had
            succeeded in conquering a country larger than Spain. Over a million Mexicans had
            perished, and those that remained left the city and fled to the mountains.</db:para>
        <db:para>In this way the magnificent civilization of the ancient Mexicans was destroyed.
            Shiploads of treasures were sent by Cortes to the Spanish king, Charles V., who rejoiced
            at the glory gained for his country.</db:para>

        <db:title>FRANCISCO PIZARRO</db:title>
        <db:para>Among the men who had been with Balboa, and who had heard of the wonderful country of
            the Incas, was Francisco Pizarro. He determined to find this rich country and to conquer
            it.</db:para>
        <db:para>Securing a band of about two hundred men, well armed and mounted on strong horses, he
            led them, in spite of terrible hardships, over mountains, through valleys, and across
            plateaus to Cajamarca, the city where the Inca, or king, was then staying.</db:para>
        <db:para>The natives gazed at the Spaniards in wonder and dread. These simple people thought
            that the white-faced, bearded strangers, who carried thunderbolts in their hands, and
            who rode such frightful-looking animals, were gods. In spite of their fear, the Indians
            received the strangers kindly, and gave them food and shelter.</db:para>
        <db:para>That evening, Pizarro and De Soto, taking with them thirty-five horsemen, visited the
            Inca and arranged with him for a meeting next day in the open square. It was a strange
            visit. The Inca was surrounded by his slaves and chieftains, and was very polite to the
            strangers.</db:para>
        <db:para>But the Spaniards began to feel very uneasy. An army composed of thousands of Indians
            was encamped only two miles away; and compared with it, the two hundred men of Pizarro
            appeared powerless. The situation of the Spaniards, should the Inca decide to oppose
            them, seemed without hope.</db:para>
        <db:para>Pizarro scarcely slept that night. He lay awake planning how he might take the Inca
            prisoner.</db:para>
        <db:para>The next day, about noon, the Indian procession approached the market place. First
            came attendants who cleared the way; then followed nobles and men of high rank, richly
            dressed, and covered with ornaments of gold and gems. Last came the Inca, carried on a
            throne of solid gold, which was gorgeously trimmed with the plumes of tropical birds.</db:para>
        <db:para>The Indian monarch wore rich garments adorned with gold ornaments, and around his neck
            was a collar of superb emeralds of great size and brilliancy. He took his position near
            the center of the square, his escort, numbering several thousand, gathered around him.</db:para>
        <db:para>Looking about, the Inca failed to see any of the Spaniards.</db:para>
        <db:para>"Where are the strangers?" he asked.</db:para>
        <db:para>Just then Pizarro's chaplain, with his Bible in his hand, approached the Inca. The
            chaplain said that he and his people had been sent by a mighty prince to beg the Inca to
            accept the true religion and consent to be tributary to the great emperor, Charles V.,
            who would then protect them.</db:para>
        <db:para>The Inca grew very angry at this, and declared that he would not change his faith nor
            be any man's tributary. He then indignantly threw the sacred book upon the ground, and
            demanded satisfaction from the Spaniards for this insult to him.</db:para>
        <db:para>At this the priest gave the signal, and the Spaniards rushed from their hiding-places
            and attacked the panic-stricken Indians. The Inca and his attendants were wholly
            unprepared, being unarmed and utterly defenseless.</db:para>
        <db:para>The Spaniards charged through them, showing no mercy, their swords slashing right and
            left, and their prancing horses trampling the natives under foot. The guns and firearms
            of the Spaniards made such havoc and confusion that the terrified Indians offered no
            resistance. Indeed, they could not offer any.</db:para>
        <db:para>In the vicinity of the Inca the struggle was fierce. The Indians, faithful to the last
            to their beloved monarch, threw themselves before him, shielding him with their naked
            bodies from the swords of the Spaniards. At last, as night drew near, the Spaniards,
            fearing that the Inca might escape, attempted to kill him.</db:para>
        <db:para>But Pizarro desired that he should be taken alive, and in a loud voice ordered his
            followers, as they valued their own lives, not to strike the Inca. Stretching out his
            arm to save the monarch, Pizarro received a wound on his hand, This was the only wound
            received by a Spaniard during the attack.</db:para>
        <db:para>At length the Inca was cast from his throne, and, falling to the ground, was caught by
            Pizarro. He was then imprisoned and placed under a strong guard. As soon as the news of
            the capture of the Inca spread, all resistance ceased. Many of the Indians fled to the
            mountains, leaving untold wealth at the disposal of their conquerors, while others
            remained, hoping to be able to assist their fallen ruler.</db:para>
        <db:para>As soon as the Inca had an opportunity, he tried to think of some way of obtaining his
            freedom.</db:para>
        <db:para>The room in which he was confined was twenty-two feet in length by seventeen feet in
            width. Raising his hand as high as he could, the Inca made a mark upon the wall, and
            told Pizarro that gold enough to fill the room to that mark would be given as a ransom
            for his release.</db:para>
        <db:para>Pizarro agreed to this bargain, and the natives began to send gold to the Inca to
            secure his release. Some of the treasures in the temples were buried and hidden by the
            priests; but ornaments of all kinds, vases, and plate were collected, and in a few
            months gold amounting to fifteen millions of dollars in our money was divided among the
            Spaniards.</db:para>
        <db:para>Millions of dollars' worth of gold and silver were shipped to Spain, and the Spanish
            nation grew very wealthy. Pizarro himself returned to Spain to take Charles V. his share
            of the plunder. During Pizarro's absence the Spaniards caused the Inca to be killed,
            notwithstanding the large ransom which they had accepted.</db:para>
        <db:para>The richer the Spanish people grew, the more careless they became in their treatment
            of other nations and of those under their rule. They grew more cruel and more merciless
            and more greedy for gold. They flocked in great numbers to South America, a reckless,
            adventurous, unprincipled horde, ready to commit any crime in order to secure
        gold.</db:para>

        <db:title>FERDINAND DE SOTO</db:title>
        <db:para>Among the men who had been with Pizarro in Peru was Ferdinand de Soto, a bold and
            dashing Spanish cavalier.</db:para>
        <db:para>De Soto was appointed governor of Cuba in 1537, and at the same time received
            permission from the Spanish king to conquer Florida. This permission to conquer Florida
            was received by De Soto with great delight. He felt certain that in the interior of
            Florida there were cities as large and as wealthy as those of Peru. To conquer these
            cities, obtain their treasure, and win for himself riches and fame, was the dream of De
            Soto.</db:para>
        <db:para>Strange as it may seem to you, De Soto was also anxious to convert the natives to his
            own religion. He intended to take from them all their possessions, but he meant to save
            their souls, if possible.</db:para>
        <db:para>So, leaving his young and beautiful wife Isabella to rule over Cuba in his absence, De
            Soto, in May, 1539, started from Havana with nine vessels, about six hundred men, and
            two hundred and twenty-three horses.</db:para>
        <db:para>After a safe voyage, the expedition landed on the coast of Florida, at Tampa Bay.
            Before starting on the march to the interior of the country, De Soto sent all the
            vessels back to Cuba. In this way he cut off all hope of retreat, in case the men should
            become discouraged. But no one thought of wanting to return now. Everybody was in high
            spirits.</db:para>
        <db:para>The soldiers wore brilliant uniforms, their caps were adorned with waving plumes, and
            their polished armor glistened and sparkled in the sunshine.</db:para>
        <db:para>In the company were twelve priests, who were expected to convert the prisoners which
            De Soto meant to capture. The Spaniards carried with them chains to secure these
            prisoners, and bloodhounds to track them in case any escaped.</db:para>
        <db:para>It was a gay company which marched off into the interior of Florida with prancing
            horses, waving flags and banners, and beating drums.</db:para>
        <db:para>At first De Soto marched directly north, plunging into a wilderness which proved to be
            almost impassable. The country was full of swamps, through which the horses could
            scarcely travel. The large trees were bound together by tangled vines; and their roots,
            which protruded from the earth, were like traps, catching the feet of the travelers and
            throwing them to the ground.</db:para>
        <db:para>Besides all this, the heavy baggage which the men and horses carried weighed them down
            and made the journey almost impossible.</db:para>
        <db:para>De Soto, however, kept bravely on, encouraging his men as best he could, and at last
            reached the Savannah River. Here he changed his course to westward, hoping to find gold
            in that direction.</db:para>
        <db:para>Week after week, month after month, the Spaniards traveled on through a dense
            wilderness, enduring great hardships and finding nothing but tribes of hostile Indians.</db:para>
        <db:para>De Soto asked one of these Indian chiefs to give him slaves enough to carry his
            baggage through the forest. The chief refused; whereupon De Soto and his men attacked
            the tribe and took many prisoners. These prisoners De Soto caused to be chained together
            and placed in front of the expedition, where they were made to act as guides as well as
            slaves.</db:para>
        <db:para>Then De Soto asked the Indians where the great cities with gold and silver treasures
            were. One Indian said he did not know of any. At this reply De Soto caused the Indian to
            be put to death with frightful torture. This made the Indians untruthful, and they told
            De Soto many different stories of places where they thought gold might be found.</db:para>
        <db:para>So the expedition wandered on, searching for the gold which they never found; and the
            men grew discouraged and heartsick, and longed for home.</db:para>
        <db:para>The Indian tribes, angry at the cruel treatment of the Spaniards, attacked them
            frequently, and De Soto and his men scarcely ever enjoyed a peaceful rest at night. The
            Spaniards were unused to Indian warfare, and were no match for the quick, nimble
            savages, who glided through the forests silently and swiftly. These Indians never came
            to open battle, but hid themselves behind rocks and trees, and were scarcely ever seen.
            Two or three would suddenly appear, send a shower of arrows at the Spaniards, and then
            dart away again into the woods. The Indians scarcely ever missed their aim, and the
            Spaniards never knew when they were near.</db:para>
        <db:para>One day De Soto captured some Indians who said that they knew where gold was to be
            found and that they would show the way to the place. De Soto only half trusted them, but
            he allowed them to lead the way. The cunning savages led the Spaniards into an ambush,
            where other Indians attacked them fiercely, killing their horses and many of their men.</db:para>
        <db:para>As punishment for this act, De Soto ordered that these Indians should be torn to
            pieces by the bloodhounds.</db:para>
        <db:para>Sometimes the Spaniards, in their wanderings, passed camps where the Indians were
            gathered round huge bonfires, singing, dancing, yelling, and shouting the terrible
            Indian war whoop. Under shelter of this noise the Spaniards would steal quietly away and
            avoid the Indians for a time.</db:para>
        <db:para>At length, after wandering for two years, De Soto came, in 1541, to the shore of a
            large river. This river was wide and muddy, and had a strong current which carried much
            driftwood along with it. De Soto learned from the Indians that it was called
            Mississippi, or the "Father of Waters."</db:para>
        <db:para>He had reached it near the spot where the city of Memphis now stands, and here his
            company halted and camped.</db:para>
        <db:para>At this place the Spaniards built rafts, striking the fetters from their captives in
            order to use the iron for nails, and so crossed the river. They hoped in this way to
            escape from their savage foes; but on the other side of the river they found Indians who
            were just as fierce.</db:para>
        <db:para>So the Spaniards traveled south, hoping by following the course of the river to reach
            the sea. This De Soto soon found to be impossible, as the country was a wilderness of
            tangled vines and roots, and his followers could not cross the many creeks and small
            rivers which flowed into the Mississippi. The horses traveled through this country with
            difficulty, often being up to their girths in water. Each day saw the little band grow
            less in numbers.</db:para>
        <db:para>At length they returned to the banks of the river, being guided back by their horses.
            The men lost their way in the dreadful forest, but the instinct of the noble animals
            directed them aright.</db:para>
        <db:para>Food was growing scarce, and De Soto himself was taken ill. He knew that unless
            something should be done soon to make the Indians help them, all would perish. So he
            sent word to an Indian chief saying that he was the child of the sun, and that all men
            obeyed him. He then declared that he wanted the chief's friendship, and ordered him to
            bring him food.</db:para>
        <db:para>The chief sent back word that if De Soto would cause the river to dry up he would
            believe him. This, of course, De Soto could not do.</db:para>
        <db:para>He was disappointed and discouraged at not being able to get food. The illness from
            which he was suffering grew worse, and he died soon afterwards.</db:para>
        <db:para>His followers were anxious to hide his death from the natives, who were very much
            afraid of him. So they placed his body in the hollow of a scooped out tree, and sunk it
            at midnight in the water.</db:para>
        <db:para>Those of his followers who were left decided to try to reach home by following the
            river to its mouth. These men were in a wretched condition. Their clothing was nearly
            all gone. Few of them had shoes, and many had only the skins of animals and mats made of
            wild vines to keep them warm. They built seven frail barks and sailed down the
            Mississippi, avoiding Indians all the way, and in seventeen days they came to the Gulf
            of Mexico.</db:para>
        <db:para>In fifty days more they succeeded in reaching a Spanish settlement on the coast of
            Mexico, where they were received with much joy.</db:para>
        <db:para>Of the gay company of six hundred and twenty who had set out with such high hopes,
            only three hundred and eleven men returned.</db:para>

        <db:title>THE GREAT RIVER AMAZON, AND EL DORADO</db:title>
        <db:para>As you may imagine, there was great excitement and curiosity in Spain, after the
            voyages of Columbus, about the new lands beyond the Western Ocean.</db:para>
        <db:para>Several of the men who had sailed with Columbus were ready to undertake new voyages of
            discovery. Among them was Yañez Pinzon.</db:para>
        <db:para>You will remember that when Columbus made his first voyage he set out with three
            vessels. One of these was the Niña. It was commanded by Yañez Pinzon.</db:para>
        <db:para>After Columbus had returned from his second voyage, Yañez Pinzon succeeded in fitting
            out a fleet to go to the New World.</db:para>
        <db:para>In 1499 he sailed with four caravels from Palos, the same port from which Columbus had
            sailed. Pinzon took with him some of the sailors who had been with Columbus, and also
            his three principal pilots. These pilots were men who understood how to use the
            astrolabe and to tell the course of the ship at sea.</db:para>
        <db:para>Pinzon's fleet sailed toward the Canary and Cape Verde Islands, and after passing them
            its course was southwest across the Atlantic. At length the fleet crossed the equator,
            and Pinzon was the first explorer to cross the line in the western Atlantic.</db:para>
        <db:para>The fleet sailed on for nearly five hundred miles to the southward. Here Pinzon met a
            terrific storm, which came very near sending his whole fleet to the bottom. He was now
            not far from the coast, and after the storm was over he discovered land. The land proved
            to be the most eastern point of South America. This was in the month of January, in the
            year 1500.</db:para>
        <db:para>Pinzon and a company of his men went ashore. They did not remain long, however, as
            they found the Indians very hostile. The Indians attacked the Spaniards and killed
            several of their number. They were so furious that, after chasing the Spaniards to their
            boats, they waded into the sea and fought to get the oars. The Indians captured one of
            the rowboats, but the Spaniards at last got off to their vessels.</db:para>
        <db:para>Pinzon then set sail and steered northward along the coast.</db:para>
        <db:para>When his fleet came near the equator, he noticed that the water was very fresh.
            Accordingly he gave orders to fill the water casks of his fleet. The freshness of the
            water of the sea led him to sail in toward the shore.</db:para>
        <db:para>At length he discovered whence the large volume of fresh water came. It flowed out of
            the mouth of a great river.</db:para>
        <db:para>It was the mouth of the river Amazon, and so great is the volume of water which it
            pours into the sea that its current is noticed in the ocean two hundred miles from the
            shore.</db:para>
        <db:para>This fact is not so surprising when we learn that the main mouth of this great river
            is fifty miles wide, that the river is four thousand miles long, including its windings,
            and that, besides many smaller branches, it has five tributaries, each over a thousand
            miles long, and one over two thousand miles long, flowing into it.</db:para>
        <db:para>Pinzon anchored in the mouth of the river, and found the natives peaceful. In this
            respect they were unlike those he had met farther south. They came out to his ships in a
            friendly way in their canoes. But when Pinzon, a short time later, left the river, he
            cruelly carried off thirty-six of the Indians who had been friendly to him.</db:para>
        <db:para>While Pinzon's fleet was in the mouth of the river, it came a second time near being
            wrecked.</db:para>
        <db:para>Pinzon was, of course, in strange waters. He did not know that twice each month the
            tide does not rise in the usual way, but rushes up the mouth of the Amazon with great
            force. The tide, as a rule, is about six hours in rising and six hours in falling. In
            the mouth of the Amazon, however, at new moon and at full moon the tide swells to its
            limit in two or three minutes. It comes as a wall of water, twelve or fifteen feet high,
            followed by another wall of the same height. Often there is a third wall of water, and
            at some seasons of the year there is a fourth wall.</db:para>
        <db:para>This peculiar rising of the tide is called the bore. The noise of this rushing flood
            can be heard five or six miles off. It comes with tremendous force, and sometimes
            uproots great trees along the banks. During the few days when the tide rushes up the
            river in this way vessels do not remain in the main channel, but anchor in coves and
            protected places.</db:para>
        <db:para>Pinzon, as we have said, did not know about the sudden rising of the tide. His fleet
            was anchored in the main channel when the bore came, and it dashed his vessels about
            like toy boats and almost wrecked them.</db:para>
        <db:para>After repairing the damage done to his fleet, he made up his mind that there was
            little gold to be found in those parts, and so he sailed out of the mouth of the great
            river, and then turned northward along the coast.</db:para>
        <db:para>It may be of interest to know what befell Pinzon after he left the mouth of the
            Amazon. We will tell you briefly.</db:para>
        <db:para>He sailed along the coast to the northwest, and passed the mouth of the Orinoco,
            another large river of South America. About a hundred and fifty miles beyond the
            Orinoco, he entered a gulf and landed. Here he cut a large quantity of brazil wood to
            take back to Spain.</db:para>
        <db:para>Then he sailed for the island of Hispaniola, now called Haiti. From this island he
            sailed to the Bahama Islands.</db:para>
        <db:para>It was July when he reached the Bahamas. Misfortune again came to his fleet. While
            anchored in the Bahamas a hurricane came up, and two of his vessels were sunk. A third
            was blown out to sea. The fourth vessel rode out the storm, but the crew, thinking all
            the while she would sink, took to their small boats and at length reached the shore. The
            Indians came to them when they landed, and proved friendly.</db:para>
        <db:para>After the hurricane was over, the vessel that had been carried out to sea drifted
            back. As soon as the sea was smooth enough Pinzon and his men went on board the two
            remaining vessels and set sail for Hispaniola.</db:para>
        <db:para>At Hispaniola he repaired his vessels, and then sailed back to Spain. He reached Palos
            in September.</db:para>
        <db:para>About three months after Pinzon sailed away from the mouth of the Amazon it was
            visited by a Portuguese navigator named Cabral. Although the Portuguese were not so
            fortunate as to discover America, yet they had been very active in making discoveries
            for seventy years and more before Columbus's first voyage.</db:para>
        <db:para>In 1420 they discovered the Madeira Islands. In 1432 they discovered the Azore
            Islands, which lie eight hundred miles west of Portugal in the Atlantic Ocean. Their
            vessels, from time to time, had been pushing farther and farther down the west coast of
            Africa. In the middle of the century as many as fifty-one of their caravels had been to
            the Guinea coast, or the Gold Coast, as it was more often called. In 1484, eight years
            before Columbus discovered America, they had discovered the mouth of the Kongo River on
            the African coast.</db:para>
        <db:para>It is not surprising, then, that their navigators were pushing out across the Atlantic
            soon after Columbus had led the way.</db:para>
        <db:para>But though Cabral sailed along the whole coast of Brazil, and took possession of it in
            the name of the King of Portugal, he did not learn any more about the great river at the
            mouth of which he anchored than did Pinzon. Had he waited a few months, or had he
            returned to the river, he might easily have explored its course. For from July to
            December of each year the east wind blows steadily up the Amazon, and Cabral could have
            spread his sails and kept them spread as he sailed up the river for two thousand miles
            or more to the eastern foot of the great mountains of South America, the Andes.</db:para>
        <db:para>The exploration of the Amazon, however, fell to the lot of another man, Francisco
            Orellana by name. Orellana did not sail up the river from its mouth, but came down it
            from one of its sources. This was in 1540, many years, as you see, after Pinzon and
            Cabral had anchored at the mouth.</db:para>
        <db:para>Orellana was one of Pizarro's men, and had been with him when the Inca of Peru was
            taken and afterwards put to death. It was Francisco Pizarro, as you well know, who
            conquered Peru. After Francisco Pizarro had conquered the country, he made his brother,
            Gonzalo Pizarro, governor of Quito.</db:para>
        <db:para>This brother, while at Quito, made up his mind to cross the Andes Mountains and
            explore the country beyond. So he got ready an expedition, and made Orellana his
            lieutenant; Orellana was, therefore, second in command of the expedition.</db:para>
        <db:para>The army was made up of three hundred and fifty Spaniards, four thousand Indians, and
            one thousand bloodhounds for hunting down the natives.</db:para>
        <db:para>They had a hard march over the Andes, and suffered very much in crossing. When they
            were over the mountains, they discovered a river flowing toward the southeast. This was
            the river Napo.</db:para>
        <db:para>Pizarro had had so hard a march across the Andes that he felt his men could not stand
            it to go back by the same way. He therefore encamped by the Napo River, and spent seven
            months in building a vessel to hold his baggage and those of his men who were ill.</db:para>
        <db:para>He put Orellana in charge of the vessel, and ordered him to float slowly down the
            river while the other part of the army marched along the shore. The march was very slow
            and toilsome, and after a few weeks the food began to get low.</db:para>
        <db:para>At this time Pizarro heard of a rich country farther down the stream, where the Napo
            flowed into a larger river. This country he wished to reach. So he sent Orellana in the
            vessel, with fifty soldiers, down the Napo to the larger river. There Orellana was to
            get food and supplies for the army and then return.</db:para>
        <db:para>Pizarro waited and waited in vain for Orellana to return, and at last he and his men
            had to find their way back across the Andes with scanty food and undergo great
            hardships.</db:para>
        <db:para>Orellana and the soldiers with him were carried by the current swiftly down the Napo,
            and in three days they came into the great river. It was indeed a great river, for the
            Amazon at the place where the Napo flows into it is a mile in width.</db:para>
        <db:para>Orellana expected to find here many people and plenty of food. He found, however, only
            a wilderness. It was about like the country where Pizarro and his army were encamped.</db:para>
        <db:para>Orellana could barely get food for himself and the men with him, much less enough for
            Pizarro and his army. To return against the swift current would be a heavy task. After
            thinking the matter over, he decided to follow the great river to the sea. But he must
            first win the soldiers who were with him over to his plan. This he soon succeeded in
            doing, and they started down the Amazon.</db:para>
        <db:para>It was no easy journey. He and the soldiers suffered greatly. But in August, 1541,
            after seven months of hardships, they reached the ocean, and a short time after this
            they sailed to Spain.</db:para>
        <db:para>When Orellana reached Spain, he gave a glowing account of a wonderful country, rich in
            precious metals, through which he had passed. According to his story, it was far richer
            in gold than Peru.</db:para>
        <db:para>The name El Dorado, "The Golden," was given to this fabled country; and for a score or

            Expedition after expedition set out in search of El Dorado. An explorer named Philip von
            Hutten, who led a party southward into the country from the northern part of South
            America, believed he caught sight of a city whose golden walls glistened far away in the
            distance. But he never reached the shining city which he thought he saw, nor was the
            fabled El Dorado ever found.</db:para>

        <db:title>VERRAZZANO</db:title>
        <db:para>Verrazzano was a native of Florence, Italy, and a pirate like many other sailors of
            that time. Being known as a daring seaman, he was asked by Francis I., King of France,
            to take command of a fleet of four vessels and try to find a western passage to rich
            Cathay. For Francis had become very jealous of the Spaniards, and felt that his country
            ought to have a share in the riches of the New World.</db:para>
        <db:para>Verrazzano sailed from France full of hope and joy; but he had gone only a short
            distance when a severe storm arose, and two of his vessels were lost sight of forever.
            The two remaining vessels were obliged to return to France.</db:para>
        <db:para>After some delay Verrazzano started again, with one vessel called the Dauphine. With
            this vessel he reached the island of Madeira, and from this island he sailed, January
            17, 1524, for the unknown world.</db:para>
        <db:para>The voyage lasted forty-nine days, after which time a long, low coast was sighted in
            the distance. This coast, which was probably North Carolina, afforded no landing place,
            and for some time Verrazzano sailed north and then south, searching for one. The search
            proved unsuccessful, and as the crew were in need of fresh water, Verrazzano decided to
            send a boat ashore.</db:para>
        <db:para>So a small boat was manned, and the sailors tried very hard to reach the shore, but
            the surf was so high that they were unable to do this. At last one brave sailor jumped
            from the boat into the foaming breakers and swam toward the shore. He carried in one
            hand presents for the Indians, who were standing at the water's edge watching the
            strange sight. At length the sailor succeeded in swimming so close to the shore that he
            was able to throw the presents to the Indians.</db:para>
        <db:para>His courage then deserted him, and in terror he tried to swim back to his vessel. The
            surf, however, dashed him on the sandy beach, and he would have been drowned had not
            some of the Indians waded in and dragged him ashore. These Indians quickly stripped him
            of all his clothing and began to build an immense bonfire. The poor sailor thought his
            end had come, and his former companions looked on from their ship in horror at the
            preparations.</db:para>
        <db:para>All of them thought that the Indians meant to burn him alive or else to cook and eat
            him. To their great relief, the Indians treated him very gently and kindly; they dried
            his clothes by the fire and warmed him.</db:para>
        <db:para>These kind Indians looked very savage. Their skin was copper colored, their long,
            straight hair was tied and worn in a braid, and their faces were very stern; for, you
            know, an Indian never laughs or smiles.</db:para>
        <db:para>In spite of their fierce looks, however, they were very good to the pale-faced
            stranger, and when he was strong again they led him back to the shore, and he swam out
            to his ship.</db:para>
        <db:para>Verrazzano was glad to see his sailor return in safety from this dangerous trip. The
            man had risked his life, but no water had been obtained for the crew. So Verrazzano
            started northward, and along the coast of Maryland he made a landing and secured the
            much-needed fresh water.</db:para>
        <db:para>At this place the Frenchmen had an opportunity to return the kindness that the Indians
            had shown their companion, but I am sorry to have to tell you that they did not do so.
            While searching for the water, Verrazzano and his followers came suddenly upon a little
            Indian boy, whom they seized and carried off to their ship. The mother of the boy came
            quickly from some bushes to rescue her son, and they would also have stolen her, but she
            made so much noise that they were obliged to run in order to escape from the rest of the
            tribe, who came to help her. The Frenchmen reached their ship in safety with the poor
            little Indian boy, and quickly set sail.</db:para>
        <db:para>Verrazzano proceeded northward, following the shore, and at length came to a very
            narrow neck of water, with rising land on both sides. Through this strait Verrazzano
            sailed, and, to his surprise, came out into a broad and beautiful bay which was
            surrounded on all sides by forests, and was dotted here and there with the canoes of
            Indians who were coming out from the land to meet him.</db:para>
        <db:para>You have, of course, guessed that this strait was the Narrows, which separates Staten
            Island from Long Island, and that the bay was the beautiful New York Bay.</db:para>
        <db:para>Verrazzano followed the shore of Long Island to a small island, which was likely Block
            Island. From this island he sailed into a harbor on the mainland, probably Newport,
            where he remained fifteen days. Here the Indians received their pale-faced visitors with
            great dignity and pomp. Two of the Indian chiefs, arrayed in painted deer skins and
            raccoon and lynx skins, and decorated with copper ornaments, paid Verrazzano a visit of
            state.</db:para>
        <db:para>Soon after this Verrazzano sailed away, again northward. The climate grew cooler and
            the country more rugged, and the vegetation changed. Instead of the sweet-scented
            cypress and bay trees which the sailors had admired along the Carolina coast, there were
            dark forests of stately pines, which were grand but gloomy.</db:para>
        <db:para>Great cliffs of rock extended along the shores, and from these heights the natives
            looked down upon the lonely little ship in fear, anger, and amazement. At length they
            consented to trade with the pale-faces; but they lowered a cord from the rocks and drew
            up the knives, fishhooks, and pieces of steel which they demanded in exchange for furs
            and skins. Once Verrazzano and a few of his men tried to land. But the Indians fiercely
            attacked them, and a shower of arrows and the sound of the dreaded war whoop caused the
            Europeans to fly to their ship for safety.</db:para>
        <db:para>So Verrazzano gave up the plan of landing among these fierce Indians, and continued
            his voyage northward as far as Newfoundland. Here provisions grew scarce, and Verrazzano
            decided to sail for home.</db:para>
        <db:para>The return voyage was a safe one, and Verrazzano was greeted with joy when he arrived
            in France. Upon his discoveries the French based their claim to all the country in the
            New World between Carolina and Newfoundland, extending westward as far as land
            continued.</db:para>
        <db:para>Verrazzano wished very much to go again to this new land and try to plant a colony and
            to convert the Indians to the Christian religion. But France at this time was plunged
            into war at home, and all trace of Verrazzano is lost. Some say that he made a second
            voyage, and that while exploring a wild country he was taken prisoner and killed by a
            savage tribe of Indians. The story that is most likely true is that he did return to the
            New World, and that while there he was taken prisoner by the Spaniards and hanged as a
            pirate.</db:para>

        <db:title>THE FAMOUS VOYAGE OF SIR FRANCIS DRAKE—1577</db:title>
        <db:para>Under the rule of Queen Elizabeth England became noted for her bold and daring seamen.
            These seamen were really pirates, or sea robbers; but their occupation in those days was
            looked upon as a lawful one by all except the people whom they plundered.</db:para>
        <db:para>Queen Elizabeth encouraged the seafaring men to make voyages to the New World, and
            also to attack the Spanish ships, because she was displeased at the way the Spaniards
            were behaving.</db:para>
        <db:para>The Spaniards had grown very rich and powerful by means of the wealth they had
            obtained in America, and in their pride they did not treat the other nations properly.
            They had no idea of fairness. They were selfish and wanted everything for Spain.</db:para>
        <db:para>The English people thought that the best place to attack the Spaniards was in the New
            World. They well knew that if they could cut off the supply of gold and silver which the
            Spanish nation was receiving from South America and the Indies, that nation would
            suffer.</db:para>
        <db:para>Sir Francis Drake, a brave young knight of Elizabeth's court, formed a plan to teach
            the Spaniards a lesson. This plan was approved by the queen, and Drake was promised
            glory and riches if he should succeed in carrying it out.</db:para>
        <db:para>In November, 1577, Drake sailed from Plymouth, England, with a fleet of five vessels
            and one hundred and sixty-four men. He told every one that he was going to make a voyage
            to Alexandria, as he did not wish the Spaniards to know that he intended to cross the
            Atlantic.</db:para>
        <db:para>After a voyage of about five months, as they were sailing quietly along one evening,
            the crew saw strange fires in the distance. At first the sailors were alarmed; but on
            sailing nearer they saw that the fires were on the shore of a strange country, which
            Drake knew to be South America.</db:para>
        <db:para>The natives had built these immense bonfires near the water and were preparing for
            some religious rites.</db:para>
        <db:para>These natives were friendly, and Drake, after procuring some fresh supplies, sailed
            on, as he was in haste to reach Peru. The fleet soon entered the Strait of Magellan, and
            sailed through without any mishap.</db:para>
        <db:para>On an island in the strait they found a great number of fowl of the size of geese,
            which could not fly. The crew shot about three thousand of these birds, and now, having
            plenty of provisions, they began the journey up the west coast of South America.</db:para>
        <db:para>The Spaniards, never dreaming that any one would have the courage to try to reach
            their lands by way of the Strait of Magellan, had made no attempt to defend themselves
            from attack from the south. They feared that their enemies might come down upon them by
            way of the isthmus, and strong forces had been placed there to prevent any one from
            crossing; but all the southern ports were defenseless.</db:para>
        <db:para>So Drake and his men sailed up the coast, dropping in at different harbors, boldly
            taking everything of value that they saw, and then gayly sailing away, laughing at the
            surprise they left behind them.</db:para>
        <db:para>At one place Drake found a Spanish ship laden with spoils, ready to sail to Spain. The
            English quickly took possession of her, set her crew ashore, and carried her out to sea.
            There they found that she had on board pure gold amounting to thirty-seven thousand
            Spanish ducats, stores of good wine, and other treasure.</db:para>
        <db:para>At one place where they landed Drake himself found a Spaniard lying asleep near the
            shore, with thirteen bars of silver by his side. The Englishmen took the silver and went
            quietly away, leaving the man to finish his nap.</db:para>
        <db:para>Farther on they met a Spaniard and an Indian boy driving eight llamas, as the sheep of
            that country are called, toward Peru. Each llama had on its back two bags of leather,
            and in each bag was fifty pounds of silver. This silver Drake ordered to be placed on
            his ship, and then he sailed away.</db:para>
        <db:para>Many other places were visited in this manner, and much treasure was collected; but it
            was not until Drake reached Lima that the English understood the great wealth of that
            country. About twelve ships were in the harbor, some fully laden, and all unprotected,
            as the Spaniards never dreamed of attack. These ships Drake proceeded to lighten of
            their cargo by removing it to his own ships.</db:para>
        <db:para>He then gave chase to another vessel, which he heard was laden with still greater
            treasure. This vessel he soon found, and the cargo proved to be very valuable. Thirteen
            chests of plate, many tons of gold and silver, jewels, precious stones, and quantities
            of silk and linen were taken.</db:para>
        <db:para>As you may suppose, after continuing this work for some time Drake's ships were very
            well loaded, and he and his companions began to think about returning to England. Drake
            felt that it would not be safe for him to return through the Strait of Magellan, as he
            knew the Spaniards would be expecting him. So he decided to sail across the Pacific
            Ocean to the Molucca Islands, and complete his journey by circumnavigating the globe.</db:para>
        <db:para>He was at this time becalmed in the tropics, and therefore headed his ships north,
            hoping to find the trade wind, which would carry him across the Pacific. After
            proceeding north along a strange coast for nearly a month, during which time the weather
            gradually became colder and colder, Drake decided to enter a harbor and anchor his
            vessels.</db:para>
        <db:para>The people of the country were friendly, and as the English treated them well, they
            remained so. They admired the brave Sir Francis Drake so much that they begged him to
            stay with them and be their king.</db:para>
        <db:para>But Drake had no desire to be king over an Indian tribe. He wanted to get back to his
            own good Queen Elizabeth and tell her of all the wonderful things that had happened to
            him. So he took possession of this country for England, and called it New Albion.</db:para>
        <db:para>New Albion was the land which is at present known as California, and the bay in which
            Drake anchored is just north of San Francisco Bay.</db:para>
        <db:para>Then Drake prepared his ships for the voyage home, hoisted anchor, and was soon
            sailing away in the direction of the Moluccas. These islands he reached after a long
            voyage, and after visiting several of the Indies he proceeded across the Indian Ocean to
            the Cape of Good Hope and thence northward to England. He reached home in September,
            1580, after an absence of three years.</db:para>
        <db:para>How glad Queen Elizabeth was to see him! She granted him the honor of knighthood, and
            in other ways showed her pride in her brave subject.</db:para>
        <db:para>Drake's ship, the Golden Hind, was placed in a dock at Deptford, where it stood for
            many years. People used to take their children to see it, and they would tell them about
            the Golden Hind, the good ship in which sailed the brave general, Sir Francis Drake,
            when he taught the Spaniards a lesson.</db:para>
        <db:para>When the timber of the ship began to decay, a chair was made of some of it and given
            to Oxford University, where it may be seen to this day.</db:para>
